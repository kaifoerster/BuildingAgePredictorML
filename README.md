# Building Age Predictor using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the age of commercial buildings using a unique combination of data sources, including commercial building data, 2D urban morphology data, and Google Street View images. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we provide insights into urban development patterns and architectural evolution.

## Features
- **Data Integration**: Combines diverse datasets to create a comprehensive prediction model.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various ML algorithms to explore and predict building ages.
- **Visualization**: Offers graphical insights into the data and model performance.

## Abstract

> This paper predicts building ages across the Netherlands, Spain, and France by combining commercial building data, open-source 2D urban morphology data, and street view images. This integration marks the first use of these heterogeneous data sources for cross-country age prediction, addressing previously identified research gaps by quantifying the standalone and combined value of each data source in predicting building age. Furthermore, the study documents a novel application of open-source street view images at a larger scale, expanding the geographical scope of street view image use in scientific research beyond regional study cases.
> 
> The study demonstrates that deep learning and machine learning models together can effectively estimate building age across national borders, leveraging on the unique information advantages of each data source. However, the use of open-source street view images used in this study requires significant preprocessing to be effective, and the integration of heterogeneous data types (image and tabular) presents challenges.
> 
> From a policy side, this study broadens the availability of scalable, cost-effective building data, supporting urban planning and risk management efforts to adapt European infrastructures to climate change. The research emphasizes the significance of building age data in determining energy efficiency and shaping retrofitting strategies across Europe. Additionally, this data can help to evaluate the European financial systemâ€™s transition risks associated with environmental non-compliance and assist in estimating physical risks posed by natural hazards.
